i was thinking an interesting abstraction of 2 Sum would be to try something separate from numbers but still had a similar logic, unique things where Target - Current = Complement and sibling Complements equal their target. I was thinking shapes like a circle could do this well in a visually fun and interesting way. where a circle (the Target) could be cut in half using a smooth perlin noise / bezier curve path to make 2 puzzle like pieces. These would be siblings and only they uniquely would combine to form the target. 2 Sum with puzzle pieces would then turn into a list of arbitrary list of puzzle pieces where the same algorithm was used to find the siblings. 

I tried a number of ways to make these shapes and wasn't coming up with any suitable simple way to generate many of them programatically and thought maybe i'd put this project on the shelf for now as it may be too advanced at this moment.

here's an idea for teaching beginners 2 sum. 

no code for now, just thinking

on our UI we can have a teach button.

when clicked we'll have instructions for the user to play a simple, manual version of 2 sum. asking them to write numbers 1 through 20 on small pieces of paper and then shuffle them and stack them in a pile.

then we'll give them a target number. we'll ask them to go through the list calculating what complement number when added to their current number will add up to our target number, to write that down on another piece of paper that they'll keep referring and checking. 

then for each new number they flip over from their shuffled stack they'll check the potential complement list to see if they've already encountered that number previously. if they have they've found a solution if not, calculate and keep going..

basically we're getting them to do a 2 Sum by pencil and paper.

then we'll discuss with them the challenges and problems with this.

then we'll make analogies to their various paper tools to computer tools

so the stack of papers with numbers written will be an array, the calculation will be a math function, the memory paper will be our Map..

we'll show examples of how each work

and then we'll have them step through the computer equivalent of the 2 Sum problem that is our visual explainer. 

finally we'll show the actual 2 Sum code and show how that relates to our visualizer parts.

This sounds like a great way to teach the 2 Sum problem! Here's a step-by-step plan to implement this teaching tool:

Step-by-Step Plan:
Introduction:

Start with a brief explanation of what the 2 Sum problem is.
Explain that they will first solve it manually and then see how it can be solved with a computer.
Manual Version with Paper:

Provide instructions for writing numbers 1 through 20 on small pieces of paper.
Ask them to shuffle these pieces and stack them in a pile.
Give them a target number (e.g., 25).
Finding Complements:

Ask them to flip over the top number from the stack and calculate what number, when added to this number, will equal the target number. This is the complement.
Have them write down each complement on another piece of paper (complement list).
Checking for Solutions:

For each new number they flip over, they should check the complement list to see if it contains this number.
If the number is found in the complement list, they've found a solution. If not, they continue to calculate the complement and add it to the list.
Discussion:

Discuss the challenges they faced during this manual process (e.g., keeping track of complements, ensuring all numbers are checked, etc.).
Introduce the concept of how computers can help automate this process and make it more efficient.
Analogies to Computer Tools:

Explain that the stack of papers is like an array in a computer.
The calculations they performed are like a mathematical function.
The complement list is similar to a Map or dictionary in programming.
Computer-Based Visual Explainer:

Show them the visual explainer you created in the previous steps.
Walk them through the computer equivalent of the steps they manually performed.
Highlight how each part of the visualizer corresponds to the paper-based tools they used.
Actual 2 Sum Code:

Present the actual code for the 2 Sum problem.
Relate each part of the code to the steps they manually performed and the visual elements in the explainer.
Explain how the code automates the process and makes it more efficient.
Interactive Step-Through:

Allow them to step through the visual explainer, highlighting the current number, the complement calculation, and the Map checks.
Ensure they understand each step and how it corresponds to the manual process they did.
Implementation:
You can create an interactive UI with the following components:

Teach Button:

When clicked, display the step-by-step instructions for the manual version.
Visual Explainer:

Implement a step-through version of the 2 Sum problem with visual elements showing the array, complement calculations, and Map checks.
Code Display:

Show the actual 2 Sum code and highlight how each part corresponds to the visual explainer and manual process.
This approach will provide a comprehensive understanding of the 2 Sum problem, starting from a hands-on manual process to an automated computer solution.
