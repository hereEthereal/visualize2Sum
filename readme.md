i was thinking an interesting abstraction of 2 Sum would be to try something separate from numbers but still had a similar logic, unique things where Target - Current = Complement and sibling Complements equal their target. I was thinking shapes like a circle could do this well in a visually fun and interesting way. where a circle (the Target) could be cut in half using a smooth perlin noise / bezier curve path to make 2 puzzle like pieces. These would be siblings and only they uniquely would combine to form the target. 2 Sum with puzzle pieces would then turn into a list of arbitrary list of puzzle pieces where the same algorithm was used to find the siblings. 

I tried a number of ways to make these shapes and wasn't coming up with any suitable simple way to generate many of them programatically and thought maybe i'd put this project on the shelf for now as it may be too advanced at this moment.
