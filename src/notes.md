Step and Substep Logic Implementation:

Introduced a more detailed step and substep mechanism to guide through the 2 Sum problem process. Each step is broken down into substeps for more granular visualization and explanation.
Steps include: inquiry to the Map, response from the Map, calculation in Math, and adding the complement to the Map.
Enhanced Visual Representation:

Added arrows and labels to visually represent the inquiry, response, calculation, and addition steps. This provides a clearer understanding of the 2 Sum problem-solving process.
Dynamic Status Updates:

The status section now updates dynamically based on the current step and substep. This provides a more comprehensive explanation of the ongoing process.
Math Component Enhancements:

Modified the Math component to show detailed calculation information only during the relevant substeps. The Math component displays two lines of text: a static formula and a dynamic result.
Improved Component Communication:

Improved the logic for components to communicate through the Global Controller, ensuring accurate information flow and coordination.
Error Handling and Debugging:

Added more robust error handling and debugging information, such as logging positions and steps. This helps identify and fix issues more efficiently.
Visual Clean-Up:

Removed unnecessary elements like the troubleshoot line and step back buttons to simplify the interface and focus on the core functionality.
TypeScript Enhancements:

Refined TypeScript definitions and interfaces to ensure better type safety and code readability. This included the correct use of type annotations and ensuring the interfaces accurately represent the component structures.
Component Isolation:

Improved the modularity of the code by isolating component logic and ensuring each component handles its own responsibilities. This enhances maintainability and scalability.
Map Component Index Tracking:

Updated the Map component to store the index of the current number as the value. This provides more accurate tracking and visualization of the 2 Sum problem process.
